# ComputerAnimationProject

To run to this program simply open the .app file on MacOS 10.8 or later.

Select a .skel file from your local directory using the “Select .skel” button select a corresponding .skin file using the “Select .skin” button. Use the rotate and zoom buttons to look at the object from different angles and distances. (The rotation buttons rotate the object along the specified axis).

Additionally, the menu to the right of the object shows a list of all of the object’s joints. By selecting a joint, you can rotate the joint on any axis relative to its parent joint.

A different (or the same) .skel file and/or .skin file can be selected at any time and this will reset the rotation and zoom parameters as well as load in the new object.

Additionally, the relevant files in the project folder include the ViewController files, the Balljoint files, the SkinData files, the Matrix files, the storyboard, and, most notably, the openGLView files.

Also attached are the two given .skel files and the two given .skin files for use on the project. However, any .skel/.skin files in a Users directory can be used.
